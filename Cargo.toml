# The list of dependencies below (which can be both direct and indirect dependencies) are crates
# that are suspected to be CPU-intensive, and that are unlikely to require debugging (as some of
# their debug info might be missing) or to require to be frequently recompiled. We compile these
# dependencies with `opt-level=3` even in "dev" mode in order to make "dev" mode more usable.
# The majority of these crates are cryptographic libraries.
#
# Note that this does **not** affect crates that depend on Substrate. In other words, if you add
# a dependency on Substrate, you have to copy-paste this list in your own `Cargo.toml` (assuming
# that you want the same list). This list is only relevant when running `cargo build` from within
# the Substrate workspace.
#
# If you see an error mentioning "profile package spec ... did not match any packages", it
# probably concerns this list.
#
# This list is ordered alphabetically.
