	/// used to indicate that the code is different. As long as the authoring_version and the
	/// spec_version are the same, the code itself might have changed, but the native and Wasm
	/// binaries do the same thing. In general, only non-logic-breaking optimizations would result
	/// in a change of the impl_version.
	impl_version: 0,
	/// The version of the interface for handling transactions. This parameter can
	/// be useful to synchronize firmware updates for hardware wallets or other signing
	/// devices to verify that runtime transactions are valid. The parameter allows
	/// hardware wallets to know which transactions they can safely sign. This number
	/// must be bumped if there is a change in the index of the pallets in the construct_runtime!
	/// macro or if there are any changes to dispatchable functions, such as the number of
	/// parameters or parameter types. If this number is updated, then the spec_version must also
	/// be updated.
